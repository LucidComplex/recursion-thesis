# Research Questions

Due to the gaps in knowledge, I have come up with the following questions:
 
a. What exactly do iteration-first students think when they see recursive code?
b. What is the relationship between learning linked lists iteratively or recursively to the implementation time of other data structures?
 
I have also come up with the following hypotheses:
 
a. Based on Lewis' (2014) findings of students' techniques of understanding recursion, I expect to find the students mistake recursion for looping, or make use of the concept of looping.
This is might be a small semantic error, but it is also a misconception to be thinking that recursion is the same as looping.
b. I expect a little significant difference between the 2 groups, that is, iteration and recursion will have a slightly better time.
Since according to Mirolo (2012), iteration does not appear to be easier than recursion.
However, Murphy (2015) also suggests students try to avoid using recursion.
Hence, it is worthwhile to actually figure out the truth.
