# Methodology
 
## What type of study is this?

Question a is a descriptive study, while b is a relational study.
 
## What data will be collected?
 
For a, I will collect records of the think-aloud session.
This is an observation of how students think when they see recursive code.
I will require around 20 to 30 random participants of the same year, all of which have learned iteration-first.
 
For b, I will be sampling 20 to 30 random participants of a pre-data structures course batch, which I will split into 2 groups.
Group A will be exposed learning linked lists iteratively, while group B recursively.
They will be instructed through a PDF only, so as to remove the influence of the instructor.
Both groups will then attempt to write a new data structure, according to what they were instructed to, group A will write a new data structure iteratively, and so on.

## How will the data be analyzed?
 
Study a will be analyzed by frequency of words used, and whether they successfully understand recursion.
 
Study b will be analyzed by comparing the time taken to implement their task.
Descriptive statistics will be used to test whether there was a significant difference in both groups.
