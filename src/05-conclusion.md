# Conclusion
 
This study is aimed at trying to understand what students think of recursion.
Knowing what they are thinking of allows us to adjust our focus on what the students are having difficulties with.
Furthermore, this study also serves as a survey on the performance of the students at UP Cebu.
 
This study also aims to see which between recursion or iteration is better to spend time first on.
This study may be found important by teachers, as they can be informed as to which construct to go for first, and which they should spend more time on.
Additionally, this study may also be of importance by other researchers, serving as a starting point for studies in recursion.
