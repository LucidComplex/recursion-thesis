How many participants? How often are you going to use these measures with these participants?                                                                    |                                           How are you going to analyze these data?                                          |                                                                                                          What do you expect to find? What's your hypothesis for what's going to happen?                                                                                                          |

What exactly do iteration-first students think when they see recursive code?                                                |                           Collect speak out loud thoughts of the students as they see recursive code for them to comprehend                          |                                                                               Twenty to thirty participants,  meeting once to record their open thoughts trying to understand recursive code.                                                                               | Data may be analyzed by using the frequency of a word or concept as they try to explain the recursive code they are seeing. |                                                      Based on Lewis' (2014) findings of students' techniques of understanding recursion, I expect to find the students mistake recursion for looping, or make use of the concept of looping.                                                     |
| Compare manipulating or implementing linked lists in iterative and recursive manner, to see which is better. What is the relationship between learning linked lists iteratively or recursively to the implementation time of other data structures? | Collect the time taken of 2 different groups to implement a certain data structure, after each group learns linked lists iteratively or recursively. | Twenty to 30 participants, split into 2. One group will learn linked lists iteratively, the other recursively. Then let them implement iterative and recursive implementations of new data structures, respective to what they learned. Record the time taken to implement. |      A standard T-test may be done to test whether a statistical significant difference is found between the 2 groups.      | I expect a little significant difference between the 2 groups, that is, iteration and recursion will have a slightly better time. According to Mirolo (2012), iteration does not appear to be easier than recursion. However, Murphy (2015) also suggests students try to avoid using recursion. |
