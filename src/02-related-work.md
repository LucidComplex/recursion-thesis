### Recursion Apprehension

According to Benander, et al. (1996), instructors express apprehension towards the topic of recursion.
Since recursion is difficult to trace, therefore instructors also find it difficult to teach.
It is important to be able to trace recursive code to learn, since people actually rely heavily on examples.
In a study by Pirolli & Anderson (1985), they found that people depend on examples they have learned to guide them to solving novel problems.
Tracing the examples will allows students to generalize their learned example to more novel problems.
Pirolli & Anderson (1985) further illustrates that people would use the examples as a kind of template to solve recursive problems.
